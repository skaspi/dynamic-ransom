I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,
But now Im insecure and I care what people think.
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from,
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, Id probably only sell one,

Itd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stones throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now they are laughing at our face,
Saying, wake up, you need to make money."

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out.

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No nothing else matters
